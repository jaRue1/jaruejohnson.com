# Current Projects Section Analysis

## Location and Structure
- **Component**: `components/Showcase.tsx`
- **Section ID**: `showcase`
- **Navigation**: Links to this section via navbar (needs to be verified)

## Current Implementation
The Showcase component displays two projects in a tabbed interface:

### Project 1: Nexus (Primary Focus)
- **Stakeholder**: MajorLinkx
- **Description**: Client portal for service-based businesses
- **Features**: Authentication, project timelines, status boards, document sharing, notifications

### Project 2: dothething.dev (Secondary Focus) 
- **Stakeholder**: MajorLinkx
- **Description**: Tech platform with tutorials and content
- **Features**: Tech blog, technology comparisons, YouTube content, guides

## UI Pattern
- Tabbed interface with project switching
- Gradient card design with hover effects
- Icons from react-icons (FiUsers, FiCode)
- Focus badges (Primary/Secondary)
- Feature lists with bullet points
- Consistent with overall site design language

## Issues to Address
1. User wants to remove dothething.dev from current projects
2. Make Nexus description more robust (highlight it as full platform)
3. Add "My Projects" button that navigates to new timeline page
4. Fix navbar navigation to projects section
5. Create comprehensive timeline page with all projects
